CloudVis
A Visualisation and rendering software for volumes
Using raylib and opengl

Written in C99 and glsl 3.3

Planned:
- 3d voxel resolution to allow for cuboid volumes
- Limitation settings in a config file
- Input data directory setting in config file
- More render settings (resolution, output directory)

Potential:
- Improved camera control
- Separate csv parser with volumes being stored in binary blobs
- Voxel octree for more efficient storage and rendering
